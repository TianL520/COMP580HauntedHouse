This game works best in Firefox. Please use Firefox to play our game. Firefox allows autoplay audio, but users may need to enable autoplay in the browser setting first.

# Enabling Speech Recognition (IMPORTANT!)
We use [annyang!](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang) for speech recognition which uses the WebSpeech API under the hood. 
Firefox requires users to enable WebSpeech usage before allowing websites to use the microphone.
Follow these instructions to enable WebSpeech in Firefox:
1. Open Firefox and type 'about:config' in the address bar
2. Press 'Accept the Risk and Continue' if prompted
3. Type 'webspeech' under 'Search preference name'
4. Set 'media.webspeech.recognition.enable' and 'media.webspeech.recognition.force_enable' to true using the toggle button to the right
5. When playing our game, make sure you press 'Allow' and 'Remember this decision' when prompted for microphone permission

Press spacebar on the menu page to start playing. If this doesn't work, left click anywhere on the screen and press spacebar again.
To speak, press enter. You will hear a beep, then you can speak to the microphone. Read back your choice as it is read to you by the narration. Speak slowly and clearly for best results.
